# Java-end-of-year-Project

This game is a gambling game where you spin a ball around a thing and you can place bets on different places where the ball would end up when you spin it.

This is a project I worked on with Cole Branvold at the end of the year for java. We used it to show are learning for the year and additional things. One of obstalces we ran into in the beggining was making the ball accelerate in a smooth way around in a circle. Another obstacle we ran into was when we were trying to add in the betting system with the drag and drop method with the chip were you set bets was causing issues calculating how much money you should win or lose. After we got the core mechanics we worked on polishing the game by fixing game break bugs, improving looks like the start menu, and some text to help and explain how to play the game. Overall I think both Cole and I learned how to use Java better through this project.
